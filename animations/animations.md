# Design
* Allow every animation to have 3 phases: 1 and 3 are optional and play once.  2 loops as long as needed.
  1. intro
  2. loop
  3. outro
* allow transparent backgrounds (alpha layer) so we can change/generate the backgrounds

# Animation ideas

* PUSH THE BUTTON!
* Furret eats a berry and then his eyes change (ditto or dilated pupils?) and he grows a smile
