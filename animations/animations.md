# Design
* Allow every animation to have 3 phases: 1 and 3 are optional and play once.  2 loops as long as needed.
  1. intro
  2. loop
  3. outro
  
* transparent backgrounds (alpha layer) are allowed so we can change/generate the backgrounds
* warning: SPIFFS filenames can't be too long...
* warning: use < 32 colors
* warning: use < 20 frames total

# Animation ideas

* Furret eats a berry and then his eyes change (ditto or dilated pupils?) and he grows a smile
* pulsing heart emoji eyes
* transparent (rainbow) pupils
* the worm?
* ditto furret face
* additional crops for furret walking video
* 3rd eye
