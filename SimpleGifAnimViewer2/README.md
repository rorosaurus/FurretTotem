This 2nd simple example works with of SPIFFS on ESP32/ES8266 but could be easy changed to read out of an SDcard on another chip like teensy. 
This implementation includes the necessary functions from FilenameFunctions.cpp directly inside SimpleGifAnimViewer_Impl.h

This version will work with both SmartMatrix and NeoMatrix as defined in neomatrix_config.h
